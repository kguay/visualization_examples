**Overview**

This repository is a collection of code that I have written at the Woods Hole Research Center using the R programming language. R is a scripting language similar to Python. There are some major syntatical differences between R and mainstream programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C, e.g. a period `.` in R can be part of a variable name and has nothing to do with function calls.

I have provided several examples of code that I have written to process and plot satellite data.

**PROJECTS**

**Historical and projected climate for the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ALCC)**
- Processed data seperately on NASA's Advanced Supercomputer (NAS), Pleiades
	- Extracted climate data for each park and "protected area centered ecosystem" (PACE; area directly surrounding the park)
