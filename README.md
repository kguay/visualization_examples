**OVERVIEW**

This repository is a collection of code that I have written at the Woods Hole Research Center using the R programming language. R is a scripting language similar to Python.

I have provided two examples of code that I have written to process and plot satellite data as well as some other plots from my recent paper in Global Change Biology (Guay *et al.* 2014).

**PROJECTS**

**Climate**
- Historical and projected climate for the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ALCC)
- Processed data seperately on NASA's Advanced Supercomputer (NAS), Pleiades
	- Extracted climate data for each park and "protected area centered ecosystem" (PACE; area directly surrounding the park)

*Past (PRISM and NEX DCP-30 historical; purple and pink, respectively) and future (NEX DCP-30 RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5; green and blue, respectively) temperature and precipitation data for the Deleware Water Gap (DEWA), Great Smokey Mountain (GRSM) and Shenendoah (SHEN) national parks.*

**Permafrost**
- Temperature profiles for two permafrost bore holes (u70 and u71) in northern Alaska

*Temperature depth profiles of two permafrost bore holes on the north slope of Alaska. The active layer depth (point where the ground thaws) is shown by the transition from cyan to yellow.*

**Other Plots & Maps**

I created the following figures for a study that I led last year (Guay *et al.* 2014).

*Difference between two versions of the GIMMS NDVI product (GIMMSg and GIMMS3g). Black line shows trend from 1982 to 2008. Dotted blue lines show trends before and after an increase in the âˆ†NDVI around 1997.*

*(a) NDVI and NDVI trends for GIMMSg, GIMMS3g, MODIS NBAR, MODIS, SeaWiFS, SPOT D10 and SPOT S10. (b) NDVI and NDVI trends between 2002 and 2008 (i.e. the common record between all sensors).*

*GIMMS3g NDVI trend from 1982 to 2010. Pixels with significant trends are labeled with a black dot.*
