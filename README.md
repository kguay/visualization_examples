**OVERVIEW**

This repository is a collection of code that I have written at the Woods Hole Research Center using the R programming language. R is a scripting language similar to Python. There are some major syntatical differences between R and mainstream programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C, e.g. a period `.` in R can be part of a variable name and has nothing to do with function calls.

I have provided several examples of code that I have written to process and plot satellite data.

**PROJECTS**

**Climate**
- Historical and projected climate for the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ALCC)
- Processed data seperately on NASA's Advanced Supercomputer (NAS), Pleiades
	- Extracted climate data for each park and "protected area centered ecosystem" (PACE; area directly surrounding the park)

*Past (PRISM and NEX DCP-30 historical; purple and pink, respectively) and future (NEX DCP-30 RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5; green and blue, respectively) temperature and precipitation data for the Deleware Water Gap (DEWA), Great Smokey Mountain (GRSM) and Shenendoah (SHEN) national parks.*

**Permafrost**
- Temperature profiles for two permafrost bore holes (u70 and u71) in northern Alaska

*Temperature depth profiles of two permafrost bore holes on the north slope of Alaska. The active layer depth (point where the ground thaws) is shown by the transition from cyan to yellow.*
